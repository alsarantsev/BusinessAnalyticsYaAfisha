# Business Metrics Analysis
<p> The project involves analyzing the business metrics of Yandex.Afisha, a mobile application that provides information about various events such as movie showings, exhibitions, gigs, and allows users to purchase tickets. The goal of the project is to assist marketing experts from Yandex.Afisha in making effective marketing investments.

The project requires analyzing server logs containing data on Yandex.Afisha visits spanning from June 2017 to May 2018. Additionally, a dump file with all orders made during that period and marketing expenses statistics are provided.
  
<b>Applied skills:</b> cohort analysis, Note: File details</p>

<p><h2>Questions</h2>

The main areas of study in this project are:

1. Understanding user behavior: Analyzing how people use the Yandex.Afisha app and identifying patterns and trends in user interactions.
2. Identifying purchase patterns: Determining when users typically start to make purchases after using the app and analyzing factors that influence their buying decisions.
3. Payback analysis: Examining how worthwhile where the investments?
</p>
<p><h2>Summary </h2>

1. Users spend about 60 seconds on the product, with few returning for more sessions. User activity peaks from October to March, likely due to the cold weather and the majority of events happening during this time. The lack of volatility in ticket prices also reduces the need for multiple visits.
2. Buying event tickets is usually a spontaneous one-day process. Advertisements on social media often trigger purchases. Repeat sales are not common, and recurring payments are uncertain. Ticket prices are generally consistent, except for group purchases.
3. After analyzing the provided data, it appears that the cohorts for September, June, July, and December have the highest profitability. As for the sources, it is clear that source 1 is the most valuable channel, as it has a significant lead with a gap of almost twice the profits of other sources. </p>
